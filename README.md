# PenguinLabyrinth

This is a project I made for my final 2d game design course. The maze generation is all done at runtime, so each time you play you get a different maze! The maze generation is my own algorithm, and guarentees a path between any two points in the maze.

## update 2023
Github LFS sadly does not support this project anymore, so while I am still updating the project, the code you see here is no longer fully up to date, but I think it is still fun to show was I was able to do early in my learning!

Curious how I made this? Check out my post here for more info! https://medium.com/@egan-randal/penguin-labyrinth-b08baf9e9e41
